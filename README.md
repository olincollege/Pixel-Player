# Pixel-Player

## Description 

Pixel Player takes an image from your computer (file path specified by you) and prints it out as ASCII art. The image is turned into grayscale, and then the dithered image is turned into ASCII art by assigning each gray tone to a different character. Then the ASCII art is printed onto the terminal. 

This program only loads jpgs and pngs. If you try to load any other image type, the program will crash.
